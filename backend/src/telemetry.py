# rag_pipeline.py and returned to the UI - useful for the current request,
# but nothing was persisted. This adds a query_log table so past requests
# (latency per stage, chunk counts, hop counts, success/failure) can be
# inspected after the fact, which is what "structured logging with request
# tracing" in the roadmap actually means.
